# Hi, I'm Junsuh! 

<p>I'm currently a PhD student in the Department of Materials Science & Engineering at MIT, advised by <a href="https://gallant.mit.edu/"> Professor Betar Gallant</a> and supported by the NSF GRFP. Previously, I studied Chemistry at UC Berkeley, where I researched under <a href="https://www.bediakolab.org/"> Professor Kwabena Bediako</a>. </p>

# What I'm up to right now:
* <b>As a materials scientist</b>, I'm investigating the role of the solid-electrolyte interphase in governing Coulombic efficiencies of high-energy density lithium-metal batteries.
* <b>As an educator</b>, I'm currently developing hands-on science lab curricula adaptable for students inside prison facilities with <a href="http://teji.mit.edu/">The Educational Justice Institute (TEJI)</a> at MIT.
* <b>As an outreach coordinator</b>, I help students across the country get involved with technology policy at the local government level with the <a href="https://paragonfellowship.org">Paragon Policy Fellowship</a>.

# Outside of the lab,
* I'm a <b>lifelong percussionist</b> across Western and Eastern artforms. I currently perform Japanese drums (taiko) with New England-based ensemble <a href="http://shindaiko.com/">ShinDaiko</a>.
* I occassionally <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/148107105"><b>run</b></a>.
* I try to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60820284-junsuh-kim"><b>read</b></a> once in a while.
